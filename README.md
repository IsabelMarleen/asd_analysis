asd_analysis

General Analysis:

**Workflow for ASD Data <- Main document, all early approaches, plots** messy script, but good parts

Plot MAST output against DESeq <- Plots of result comparison

**new_clustering_Pseudobulks_GO_SFARI.R <- new clustering, DESeq Analysis, GO Analysis, SFARI comparison, output comparison plot for DESEQ and MAST** decently tidy

new_clustering <- Old Version of new_clustering_Pseudobulks_GO_SFARI.R

MAST:

**ASD_Permutation <- Tutorial for Permutations, Problems with MAST** very clean and tidy script

Permutations Workflow <â€“ First Draft of ASD_Permutation

Workflow for MAST::zlm <- R version of Permutation Workflow

DESeq:

**Simon_DESeq <- Tutorial for Pseudobulks and DESeq** also very clean

Formula Variation <- Seeing if including different confounding variables makes a difference for the results of DESeq
